# X-Ray-Result-Interpreter
Introduction:
Often, doctors and radiologists properly diagnose their patients according to their X-ray scans. But sometimes patients are misdiagnosed because of human error: either the radiologist makes an erroneous interpretation of the X-rays or the scan itself was not done properly leading to false interpretations. Other times, radiologists ask their patients to re-do the scans because they do not look clear enough to interpret, which is time consuming for both patients and doctors as appointments get pushed back and rescheduled. Patients must reschedule more scan appointments and pay more money. Sick patients do not get their diagnosis in a timely manner. In extreme cases, an accurate and quick diagnosis can save a patientâ€™s life.
Objectives:
The aim of this project is to develop a program which eliminates uncertainty for radiologists when interpreting unclear chest X-rays. I will implement a convolutional neural network-based classification model that detects lung infections in X-ray imaging with high accuracy. This model will be able to classify scans into 1 of 2 categories: a normal healthy lung and an infected unhealthy lung.
